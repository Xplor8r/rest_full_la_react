# RestFull LA

Are you Hungry? Are you in LA? Need help finding a restaurant? You're in the right place! It's the app that helps the restless and empty in LA to rest and be full in LA!

RestFull LA is a project that I built with React and Redux in the Front-end and with Ruby on Rails in the Back-end. The application was created using 'gem install rails' and 'Create-React-App' in the client folder.

# Install Directions

To see the application in browser, fork and clone. Run bundle install and then Run db:migrate in the terminal. Create a .env file for a client id and client secret which can be obtained by signing up and following instructions at https://developer.foursquare.com/. Then cd into the client folder and run npm install in the terminal. Create a .env file in the client folder for your google API key which can be attained by visiting https://cloud.google.com/ and creating an account. Last run rake start to run the app in the browser.
